This post is mostly an excuse for me to clean the mess of a code that generates the thumbnails of this website, and remember how I did it.
Without further ado, let's dive into it.

## Requirements

I want a simple program that transforms a image into it's ASCII art equivalent:
- The program should be short
- The program should be easy to modify
- I should be interact with the program through a command line interface (CLI)
- The program should accept the different popular imaging formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG...)

You can see below, what I had in mind when designing the program:
