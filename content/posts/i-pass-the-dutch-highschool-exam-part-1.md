In this serie of post, I will document my journey toward getting the highest dutch highschool level degree: [the VWO diploma](https://duo.nl/particulier/vakinformatie-voor-het-staatsexamen/vwo.jsp).
I give myself two years to do it.

### Motivation

Why do I do that?
I mean I don't need it.
I am currently completing my PhD and already have a French highschool degree, so it is really not needed.

My first motivation is to up my game in dutch.
Currently I have a B1/B2 level, but have a lot of difficulty to go to the next level.
I think that putting on the internet this blog will make me accountable, and force me to work my dutch for the exam.

Furthermore, I really want to be part of the dutch society and as a bit more than an expat.
If you live in the Netherlands, you always hear: "You really don't need to learn Dutch in the Netherlands, everybody speak English."
Well, yes but no... If you plan to stay a couple of years: Sure!
But if you aim to stay, it is crazy not to learn dutch.
You will always feel a bit left aside and not have the full experience.
I feel that passing the national Dutch highschool degree will lead me to a better understanding of the dutch culture and feel more at home.

### Getting some information

Now that I made clear, why I do it. How can I do it?
Hopefully, the sister of my girlfriend is an Dutch highschool teacher. 
So, I sent her a message and apparently there are three ways to do it:

- subscribe to a school, with that option I will have to follow courses so it seems to be a bit too demanding;
- study at home with an institute already more attractive but then I depend from a private company so not sure that this is the best for me ;
- study completely independant and then I can just show up at the exam.

I think that you understood from my unbiased presentation of the different options that I will try to do it completely independantly.

### Choice of the subjects

In my next post, I will go over the different options and subject I picked and what is asked from me.
