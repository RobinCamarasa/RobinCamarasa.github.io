I give myself two years to do it.
Motivation Why do I do that? I mean I don&amp;rsquo;t need it. I am currently completing my PhD and already have a French highschool degree, so it is really not needed.
My first motivation is to up my game in dutch. Currently I have a B1/B2 level, but have a lot of difficulty to go to the next level.</description></item></channel></rss>
