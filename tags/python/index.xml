Without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into it.
Requirements I want a simple program that transforms a image into it&amp;rsquo;s ASCII art equivalent:
The program should be short The program should be easy to modify The program should accept the different popular imaging formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG&amp;hellip;) The program should produce light images (below 200kB) I should be able interact with the program through a command line interface (CLI) Now, I know what I need let&amp;rsquo;s go for it :)</description></item><item><title>Differentiable Boundary Point Extraction for Weakly Supervised Star-shaped Object Segmentation</title><link>http://robincamarasa.github.io/experience/scientific_publications/midl_2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 08:22:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://robincamarasa.github.io/experience/scientific_publications/midl_2022/</guid><description>Talk Your browser does not support the video tag.</description></item><item><title>A Quantitative Comparison of Epistemic Uncertainty Maps Applied to Multi-Class Segmentation</title><link>http://robincamarasa.github.io/experience/scientific_publications/melba_2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://robincamarasa.github.io/experience/scientific_publications/melba_2021/</guid><description>Talk</description></item><item><title>TU Delft Clinical technology master Python course - Teacher</title><link>http://robincamarasa.github.io/experience/positions/python_course/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://robincamarasa.github.io/experience/positions/python_course/</guid><description>You can find below an example of assignment I wrote for the course.
