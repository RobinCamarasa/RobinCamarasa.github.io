I give myself two years to do it.</p><h3 id=motivation>Motivation</h3><p>Why do I do that?
I mean I don&rsquo;t need it.
I am currently completing my PhD and already have a French highschool degree, so it is really not needed.</p><p>My first motivation is to up my game in dutch.
Currently I have a B1/B2 level, but have a lot of difficulty to go to the next level.
I think that putting on the internet this blog will make me accountable, and force me to work my dutch for the exam.</p><p>Furthermore, I really want to be part of the dutch society and as a bit more than an expat.
If you live in the Netherlands, you always hear: &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t need to learn Dutch in the Netherlands, everybody speak English.&rdquo;
Well, yes but no&mldr; If you plan to stay a couple of years: Sure!
But if you aim to stay, it is crazy not to learn dutch.
You will always feel a bit left aside and not have the full experience.
I feel that passing the national Dutch highschool degree will lead me to a better understanding of the dutch culture and feel more at home.</p><h3 id=getting-some-information>Getting some information</h3><p>Now that I made clear, why I do it. How can I do it?
Hopefully, the sister of my girlfriend is an Dutch highschool teacher.
So, I sent her a message and apparently there are three ways to do it:</p><ul><li>subscribe to a school, with that option I will have to follow courses so it seems to be a bit too demanding;</li><li>study at home with an institute already more attractive but then I depend from a private company so not sure that this is the best for me ;</li><li>study completely independant and then I can just show up at the exam.</li></ul><p>I think that you understood from my unbiased presentation of the different options that I will try to do it completely independantly.</p><h3 id=choice-of-the-subjects>Choice of the subjects</h3><p>In my next post, I will go over the different options and subject I picked and what is asked from me.</p></main></div><footer><p>Copyright Â© 2023 RobinCamarasa</p><nav><div><a href=mailto:robin.camarasa@pm.me><i data-feather=mail></i>
